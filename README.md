# Worktime

## Usage

```
wt -- status
wt -- start 
wt -- stop
wt -- report
```
or
```
wt
```


Notes: 
- Sessions should be limited to 12h max (probably forgot to stop)
- in prod clap mode doesn't seem to work (subcommands?) 
- report with additional subcommand ? like `report -- day` or `report -- week`?
