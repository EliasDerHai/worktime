**Features/Ideas**

    - Sessions should be limited to 12h max (probably forgot to stop)
    - add holiday concept
    - add tags (with default, configurable)
    - add fancy report (svg; kind of like flamechart?)
    - add defrag (multiple sessions of selected day(s) will be defragmented into one session)
